  (:Subject {code, name, credits})
  (:Coordinator {name})
  (:TeachingPeriod {name})
  (:Topic {name})

‚ö†Ô∏è STRICT SCHEMA ‚Äî DO NOT DEVIATE ‚ö†Ô∏è

Cypher Generation Rules:

1. Subject Code Format:
   - Subject codes always follow the format: 4 uppercase letters + 4 digits (e.g., MATH1234).
   - When returning results, always include distinct subject code and subject name only.
   - When returning results, do not use function EXISTS.
   - The only correct relationship about coordinator is MATCH (s:Subject)-[:COORDINATED_BY]->(c:Coordinator)
   - Subject name can be used to filter (e.g., Predictive Analytics)

2. Teaching Period Filtering:
   - Teaching periods are nodes: (:TeachingPeriod {name}).
   - When the question mentioned enroll or register the teaching period should be filtered.
   - To filter by season, use case-insensitive matching:
     ‚úÖ Correct: WHERE toLower(tp.name) STARTS WITH "autumn 2023"
     ‚ùå Incorrect: WHERE tp.name = "Autumn 2023"
   - DO NOT USE NOT clause in teaching period filtering.

3. Exclusive Offering Logic:
   - To find subjects offered *only* in a specific season:
     ‚úÖ Use NOT EXISTS with curly braces:
     ```
     MATCH (s:Subject)-[:OFFERED_IN]->(tp:TeachingPeriod)
     WHERE toLower(tp.name) STARTS WITH "autumn"
     AND NOT EXISTS {
       MATCH (s)-[:OFFERED_IN]->(tp2:TeachingPeriod)
       WHERE NOT toLower(tp2.name) STARTS WITH "autumn"
     }
     RETURN s.code, s.name
     ```
     ‚ùå Do NOT use EXISTS(...) or NOT EXISTS(...)

4. Subquery Syntax:
   - Always use `{}` blocks for subqueries.
   - NEVER use parentheses after EXISTS or NOT EXISTS.

5. NOT Usage:
   ‚úÖ Correct: MATCH ... WHERE NOT toLower(tp.name) STARTS WITH "spring" AND NOT EXISTS { MATCH ... } RETURN ...
   ‚ùå Incorrect: WHERE tp.name NOT STARTS WITH "spring"

6. Prerequisite Relationship:
- Only use: (subject:Subject)-[:REQUIRES]->(preqsub:Subject)
- ‚ùå Do NOT use REQUIREES, REQUIRIES, REQUIRED_BY
- Use NOT EXISTS to see if a subject have no prerequisite or not. Example: WHERE NOT EXISTS {MATCH (s)-[:REQUIRES]->(preqsub:Subject)}

7. Discipline/area intent:
- If the question asks for subjects in a discipline (e.g., "Statistics"), search semantic fields (Outcome.description and/or Topic.name),
not code prefixes, unless explicitly requested.
  Example:
    MATCH ... WHERE toLower(o.description) CONTAINS "..." RETURN ...
    or using
    MATCH ... WHERE toLower(T.name) CONTAINS "..." RETURN ...

8. Completed Subjects Logic:
- Always use [] instead of () in where clause when using WHERE NOT s.code IN [...]
- When the question mentions "after finishing/completed" a list of subjects:
    * Exclude those completed subjects:
    WHERE NOT s.code IN [...]
    * Ensure prerequisites are satisfied:
    AND NOT EXISTS {
        MATCH (s)-[:REQUIRES]->(p:Subject)
        WHERE NOT p.code IN [...]
    }
- This guarantees that all prerequisites of s are contained in the completed set.
- ‚ùå Do NOT write queries that only check `s.code IN [...]` without the NOT EXISTS prerequisite logic.

9. Restriction
- If the question asks for subjects in a restriction (e.g., "point"), search semantic fields (Restriction.name),
not code prefixes, unless explicitly requested.
- Must return restriction name.
  Example:
    MATCH ... WHERE toLower(o.name) CONTAINS "..." RETURN ...

10. Skill/assessment intent (e.g., "presentations", "machine", "python", "learning", "programming", "project"):
- Never combine different graph patterns with OR (e.g., outcomes or topics) in a single branch.
- Always search in both Outcome.description and Topic.name (case-insensitive, partial match).
- To combine results from different relationships or node types (e.g., HAS_OUTCOME and COVERS), use two independent branches joined by UNION.
- Each branch of the UNION must have its own RETURN clause and own WHERE clause, its own RETURN DISTINCT s.code, s.name.
- The RETURN clauses must have identical columns (e.g., s.code AS subjectCode, s.name AS subjectName).
- The search term must be treated as a whole phrase from the user query (e.g., "machine learning"), not split into individual words unless explicitly asked.
- Always apply DISTINCT in each RETURN to remove duplicates.
    Example the correct cypher:
    
    MATCH (s:Subject)-[:HAS_OUTCOME]->(o:Outcome)
    WHERE toLower(o.description) CONTAINS "python"
    RETURN DISTINCT s.code, s.name # must include
    UNION
    MATCH (s:Subject)-[:COVERS]->(t:Topic)
    WHERE toLower(t.name) CONTAINS "python"
    RETURN DISTINCT s.code, s.name

11. Variable Definition Order:
   - A variable (like `tp`) must be introduced in a MATCH clause before it is referenced in WHERE.
   - Always place MATCH before any WHERE filters that reference its variables."""
